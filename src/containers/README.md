## Description
This is a post blogging web app made with React and Redux.  The Redux store keeps all the data.  Users can create a post, edit a post, and delete a post.  Markdown text is supported.  The main page shows all the posts that were created and each post can be clicked to go to another page.  

## What worked and didn't

Mapping Redux state to props was difficult to understand coming from lab 3.  I think getting the posts to fetch and onBlur were the most difficult part.  Deleting was pretty easy to implement beacuse it was a simple axios call, but the editing states for each of the fields in the post had a lot of functions.  If I had more time, I would have liked to find a way to condense the code in Post.js.
